My research is focused on the neural and molecular mechanisms underlying animal behavior. I have done research on several different species including nematode worms, Atlantic Salmon and Cichlid fish.

### Brain circuits underlying social Dominance in Cichlid fish
My dissertaion research focuses on social dominance in the african cichlid fish *Astatotilapia burtoni*. In my experiments I allow males to transition from subordinate to dominant and I test how their brain changes in response. I use two different techniques to measure neural activity in the brain, cytochrome oxidase histochemistry and immediate early gene *in situ* hybridization. ![df]({{smmaguire.github.io}}/assests/darkfield_example.jpg) *An example of a cichlid brain stained with a probe for egr-1. Neurons stained green are showing a signal of increased neural activity. Controls with a "sense" probe (does not bind the target) are presented on the right*


### Smoltification in Atlantic Salmon
Smoltification is a preadative metamorphic process where juvenile salmon become ready to migrate to the ocean. My research has focused on the melanocortin hormone system. I looked at two populations in Norway, one of which migrates to the sea from central Norway and one which is landlocked from south central Norway and thus does not go through a normal smoltification process. This research was done in collaboration with Lars Ebbesson at the University of Bergen with funding from the NSF GROW program.

*These are photos of animals from our study collected at the same time. The Blege strain (top) do not under-go smoltification, while the Vosso strain (bottom) are well into smoltification by this time. You can see the typical signs of smoltification including the silver coloration and streamlined body shape.*

### Escape response in nematode worms
*C. elegans* worms face many challenges navigating their environment. They have many predators including predacious fungi. These fungi are amazing and have evolved many different ways to kill and consume nematodes and other small soil dwelling animals, including adhesive strategies, barb wire like appendages and even ballistic spores. Check out [George Barron's website](https://www.uoguelph.ca/~gbarron/2008/hdiktlis.htm) for photos of these amazing adaptations. Perhaps one of the most complex strategies involve the use of constricting rings. These fungi grow rings created from three highly specialized cells. These cells are capable of expanding over 30x in size in a very short amount of time. You can see some movies of the rings in action in our paper which is linked in the publications tab. When a nematode enters the ring the cells are triggered by contact and expand like an airbag in a car. The result is that the nematode becomes trapped alive within the ring. Slowly over the course of several hours the fungi sprouts new hyphae which degrade cuticle of the worm, grow inside and consume the worm's organs. Obviously this is a fate that the worms would like to avoid! They have evolved a special escape strategy to help them avoid these traps which involves relaxation of the neck muscles followed by backing away and making a 360 degree turn.

*These are electron micrographs I took of worms caught in traps. In panel F you can see two worms captured in traps as well as a non-expanded trap in the background. In panel G you can see a trap that is not expanded, note the ring is flat. In panel H you can see what happens when a worm is trapped, the three cells that make up the ring expand so strongly that the worms body is being compacted.*
