My research is focused on the neural and molecular mechanisms underlying animal behavior. I have done research on several different species including nematode worms, Atlantic Salmon and Cichlid fish.

### Brain circuits underlying social Dominance in Cichlid fish
My dissertaion research focuses on social dominance in the african cichlid fish *Astatotilapia burtoni*. In my experiments I allow males to transition from subordinate to dominant and I test how their brain changes in response. I use two different techniques to measure neural activity in the brain, cytochrome oxidase histochemistry and immediate early gene *in situ* hybridization. ![test]({{smmaguire.github.io}}/assests/test.jpg)


### Smoltification in Atlantic Salmon
Smoltification is a preadative metamorphic process where juvenile salmon become ready to migrate to the ocean. My research has focused on the melanocortin hormone system. I looked at two populations one of which is landlocked and thus does not go through a normal smoltification process.

### Escape response in nematode worms
