This a D3 visualization I've been working on with to allow readers to interact with the data from our paper, "The Social and Ecological Costs of and 'Over-Extended' Phenotype. [Check it out](http://smmaguire.github.io/cichlid.html)

Each node reprensents an individual fish from a wild colony of *Neolamprologous* with links representing social interactions between individuals. You can use the drop down menu to see how the social networks change over time. We manipulated the colonies on day 4, making one male more attractive. How does the network change after day 4? See for yourself! Also you can see our conclusions in the paper which is linked under the publications tab.
